A strictly organized technical reference sheet in a 2x2 grid layout showing 4 views of a High-Tier Military Laser Turret (Late-Game Heavy Energy Weapon).

**LAYOUT & FORMAT CRITERIA (CRITICAL):**
The final image must be a clean, professional reference sheet showing exactly four views.
The views must be arranged in a precise 2x2 GRID on the canvas (Aspect Ratio 1:1).
VIEWS MUST BE ISOLATED AND MUST NOT OVERLAP.
Background must be PURE SOLID WHITE (#FFFFFF).

SUBJECT DESCRIPTION (High-Tier Retro-Industrial "Siege Array"):
**CRITICAL DESIGN NOTE:** This is a massive, advanced LASER EMITTER ARRAY. NO projectile barrels.

This design is significantly larger, more complex, and heavily armored than previous tiers. It looks like a fortified emplacement.
**High-Tier Features:**
1.  **Twin-Linked Emitters:** Instead of one, it features two massive, rectangular optical housing blocks mounted side-by-side. Each has a large, glowing blue focusing aperture protected by heavy blast shutters.
2.  **Active Cooling System:** Exposed, thick pipes with glowing blue coolant run along the top and sides, leading to massive rear heat exchanger vents that look like industrial smokestacks.
3.  **Fortified Structure:** The main weapon body is covered in thick, segmented composite armor plates with visible heavy bolts.
4.  **Massive Base:** The rotating platform is huge, wider than the weapon itself, with visible heavy gears, hydraulics, and auxiliary power generators integrated into it. It looks incredibly heavy and stable.

VIEW ANGLES PROTOCOL:
The sheet must contain these 4 distinct views of the exact same object:
1. Orthographic Front View
2. Orthographic Side View
3. Orthographic Top View
4. Isometric Perspective View (3/4 view)

ART STYLE (Unified PC-98 Cel-Shading):
Retro Japanese PC-98 computer game aesthetic fused with anime cel-shading.
1. Bold, distinct black outlines on all edges.
2. Hard-edged block shading across ALL views showing weight and depth. High contrast retro anime look.
Color Palette: Off-white heavy armor, intense glowing blue energy elements and pipes, dark metallic grey mechanical parts.
